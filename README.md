# Props AirBnB Clone

So I created this air bnb clone on my local environment first using npm start. Then once I have the finished project, I create a new react app for GitHub pages and essentially copy over the work. There was some little bug fixes, for instance, when using npm start, I have to place all the images into the public folder for it to work. However, with GitHub pages, having the images folder inside SRC works normally.

# Main point of this project is to practice and get use to Props, which I have achieved. 

This is also the section 2 project of the React Scrimba course

I should probably add the project name at the top right of the navbar like the other react projects (react facts website and meme generator)
